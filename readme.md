# Antora starter
This npx starter sets up an antora docs folder with the basic folder structure. It has [lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) and hot-reload pre configured.

## Folder structure
Under `src` you can add your modules and there is already a simple page defined.

## Commands
To run the watcher and enable hot-reload run:

```bash
$ npm run watcher
```

If you just want to build the docs then run:

```bash
$ npm build
```
